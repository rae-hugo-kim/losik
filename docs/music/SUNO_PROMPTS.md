# Suno 투입 프롬프트 — 2026-09-05 배치 기록

각 곡: **Style** = Suno 스타일 필드(짧게, 장르·무드·악기·템포), **Description** = 커스텀 모드 설명/가사란에 넣는 확장 프롬프트.
오디오 업로드(Extend/Cover) 시 해당 WAV 와 함께 사용한다. 모두 instrumental.

현재 Astra 다섯 곡은 [v3 Suno 프롬프트](SUNO_PROMPTS_ASTRA_V3.md)를 사용한다. 아래는 이전 배치의 기록이며, 입력란 사용 안내는 새 문서를 우선한다. 다음 다곡 배치의 설계 방법은 [다곡 제작 지시문](MULTI_SONG_BRIEF.md)에 정리했다.

## star-cruiser-v6
**Style**
`synthwave disco, 122 BPM, B minor, driving four-on-the-floor, acoustic drum kit, finger bass, polysynth chord stabs with pushed anticipations, octave-jump lead riff, swinging synth solo, interstellar cruise, instrumental`

**Description**
```
Instrumental synthwave with a disco pulse at 122 BPM in B minor (Bm7–Em7–A7–Dmaj7 verses, Em7–A7–Dmaj7–Bm7 chorus).
Punchy acoustic-style drum kit sits in front; the bass is light and clean, never dominant.
Wide polysynth chords play a syncopated "bam— bop ba-ba" rhythm, pushing the next chord in early on the and-of-four.
Octave-jumping lead riff in the chorus; a loose, swinging synth solo section between verses.
Crash-roll risers into every section. Feel: a starship cruising between stars — glossy, propulsive, no distortion.
```

## ghost-signal-v4
**Style**
`dark synthwave thriller, 100 BPM, G minor, half-time drums, muted clavinet chords, hypnotic dotted-eighth arpeggio, semitone ostinato lead, sub bass in the final third, cymbal crash breakdown, eerie, instrumental`

**Description**
```
Instrumental horror/thriller synthwave at 100 BPM in G minor with a Phrygian pull (Gm–A♭maj7–Gm–D7).
Half-time drums with a dark ride pattern; a muted clavinet plays tense, restrained chord stabs.
Hypnotic dotted-eighth synth arpeggio and a lead built on a D–E♭ semitone ostinato.
Around the two-minute mark the tension breaks: a huge cymbal crash, one bar of silence, then the final verse returns
with a heavy, chest-pressing sub bass under the groove. Two final choruses, then a short fade.
Mood: unsettling but controlled — sinister, not loud. About 3 minutes.
```

## chrome-sunset — 세 편성 중 선택 후 하나만 사용
공통 Description
```
Instrumental city-pop / soft evening groove at 104 BPM in C major (Cmaj7–Am7–Dm7–G7 verses, Fmaj7–G7–Em7–Am7 chorus).
Warm brushed drums with ride cymbal, finger bass on root notes, gentle electric-piano melody with a sixth-leap hook.
Feel: a pleasant walk at golden hour — soft, warm, slightly bouncy, relaxed. Nothing aggressive, nothing dreamy or washed out.
```
**v4 Style**: `city pop, 104 BPM, C major, brushed drums, finger bass, steel-string acoustic guitar with palm-muted strums in the verse and open long strums in the chorus, electric piano melody, warm evening, instrumental`

**v5 Style**: `bossa-tinged city pop, 104 BPM, C major, brushed drums, finger bass, nylon-string acoustic guitar with syncopated sixteenth strums and fast chord changes, electric piano melody, warm and lightly bouncy, instrumental`

**v6 Style**: `soft city pop, 104 BPM, C major, brushed drums, finger bass, tonewheel organ long chords low in the mix, electric piano melody, warm evening glow, instrumental`

## golden-hour-v3
**Style**
`warm pop ballad groove, 94 BPM, C major, live band feel, acoustic drums with ride, finger bass, piano comping with sustain, string ensemble, polysynth hook, risers and cymbal impacts at section changes, uplifting, instrumental`

**Description**
```
Instrumental band-style pop at 94 BPM in C major over a four-chord loop (Fmaj7–G7–Dm7–Em7).
Acoustic drums with swung hi-hats in the verses and ride in the choruses; warm finger bass with walking approach notes.
Piano comping with sustain pedal carries the harmony; a string ensemble fills the space; a polysynth plays the chorus hook.
Every section change is marked by a crash-roll riser and an impact.
Late bridge drops to kick pulse and half-time bass, then explodes back into a final chorus with an octave-layered hook.
Feel: golden-hour glow, hopeful and full. About 3.5 minutes.
```

## 사용 메모
- Suno 는 스타일 필드가 짧을수록 안정적. Description 은 커스텀 모드의 가사란에 `[Instrumental]` 태그와 함께 넣거나, Cover/Extend 시 참고용.
- 코드 진행·BPM·키는 원곡 SMF 와 동일. Suno 가 키를 무시하는 경우가 많으므로 무드·악기 단어를 우선.
